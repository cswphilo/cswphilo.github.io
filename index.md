## Cheng-Syuan Wan

I am a PhD student in the [Logic and Semantics Group](https://cs.ioc.ee/lsg/) at [Tallinn University of Technology](https://taltech.ee/).
My supervisors are [Tarmo Uustalu](https://cs.ioc.ee/~tarmo/) and [Niccolò Veltri](https://niccoloveltri.github.io/).

### Research Interests
I am interested in structural proof theory and its connection with other disciplines because of the [Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence#Curry%E2%80%93Howard%E2%80%93Lambek_correspondence).
In particular, I am now working on characterizing proof systems (normally sequent calculus) for skew monoidal variant categories and from the otherside, constructing categorical models for intuitionistic (normally non commutative) multiplicative (possibly with exponential) logics.

Keywords: structural proof theory, constructive logic, categorical logic, skew monoidal category

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
