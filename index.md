### Research Interests
I am interested in structural proof theory and its connection with other disciplines.
In particular, I am now working on characterizing proof systems (normally sequent calculus) for skew monoidal variant categories and from the other side, constructing categorical models for intuitionistic (normally non commutative) multiplicative (possibly with exponential) logics.
